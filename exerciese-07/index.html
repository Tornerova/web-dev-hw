    <h1> The Little Prince </h1>
    <h2>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</h2>

        So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near — <br>
        <br><br>
        “Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”<br>
        <br>
        “It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you…”<br>
        <br>
        “Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
        <br>
        “But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.<br>
        <br>
        “Yes, that is so,” said the fox.<br>
        <br>
        “Then it has done you no good at all!”<br>
        <br>
        “It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the color of the wheat fields.” And then he added: “Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.”
