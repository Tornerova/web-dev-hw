  <div class="lyrics lyrics">

    <p> Swinging in the backyard<br>
Pull up in your fast car<br>
Whistling my name<br>
Open up a beer<br>
And you say, "Get over here<br>
And play a video game"<br>
I'm in his favourite sundress<br>
Watchin' me get undressed<br>
Take that body downtown<br>
I say, "You the bestest"<br>
Lean in for a big kiss<br>
Put his favourite perfume on<br>
Go play your video game<br>
It's you, it's you, it's all for you<br>
Everything I do<br>
I tell you all the time<br>
Heaven is a place on earth with you<br>
Tell me all the things you wanna do<br>
I heard that you like the bad girls<br>
Honey, is that true? <br>
It's better than I ever even knew <br>
They say that the world was built for two<br>
Only worth living if somebody is loving you<br>
And, baby, now you do<br>
Singin' in the old bars<br>
Swingin' with the old stars<br>
Livin' for the fame<br>
Kissin' in the blue dark<br>
Playin' pool and wild darts<br>
Video games<br>
He holds me in his big arms<br>
Drunk and I am seeing stars<br>
This is all I think of<br>
Watchin' all our friends fall<br>
In and out of Old Paul's<br>
This is my idea of fun<br>
Playin' video games<br>
It's you, it's you, it's all for you<br>
Everything I do<br>
I tell you all the time<br>
Heaven is a place on earth with you<br>
Tell me all the things you wanna do<br>
I heard that you like the bad girls<br>
Honey, is that true?<br>
It's better than I ever even knew<br>
They say that the world was built for two<br>
Only worth living if somebody is loving you<br>
And, baby, now you do<br>
It's you, it's you, it's all for you<br>
Everything I do<br>
I tell you all the time<br>
Heaven is a place on earth with you<br>
Tell me all the things you wanna do<br>
I heard that you like the bad girls<br>
Honey, is that true?<br>
It's better than I ever even knew<br>
They say that the world was built for two<br>
Only worth living if somebody is loving you<br>
And, baby, now you do<br>
Hmm, hmm, hmm<br>
(Now you do)<br>
(Now you do)<br>
Now you do<br>
(Now, now you do)<br>
(Now you do)<br>
(Now you do)
